# nhlbot

## About

nhlbot is a Python IRC bot based on [CloudBot](http://git.io/cloudbot) which is based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot) by [rmmh](http://git.io/rmmh).

## Using nhlbot

### Install

Before you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python dependencies. LXML is required.

These can be installed with `pip` (The Python package manager):

    [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt
    
If you use `pip`, you will also need the following packages on linux or `pip` will fail to install the requirements.
   ```python, python-dev, libxslt-dev, libxml2-dev.```

#### How to install `pip`

    curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py # or download with your browser
    python get-pip.py

### Run

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config` and edit it with your preferred settings.

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

`python bot.py`
